# Numerical-Option-Pricing-of-Cash-or-Nothing-Call-Option
This repository presents a numerical approach to pricing a Cash-or-Nothing Call option using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The project specifically implements the Galerkin Method with both linear(P1) and quadratic(P2) basis functions to solve the partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the option pricing model.
